# Introduction
---
On December 30th, 2031, a shuttle bound for the new found star, Hitoria, was launched. Later, on a rainy April morning in 2041, the shuttle lost all communications and disappeared on every radar near Neptune’s atmosphere. The shuttle never returned to Earth and the ten people inside were never seen again. The project to explore past Neptune was shut down and everyone started to focus on the other planets. One hundred and fifty years later in 2191, the project was back on and funded for. A crew of twelve people signed up for the mission and searched the galaxy for sixty-four long years, taking breaks on different planets. 
In 2257, the crew saw a new bright star up ahead and named it Altiria. The crew got closer to the star and realized there were six small planets huddled around the star that appeared to give life to the planets. The crew called the new found solar system the ILA- the Imaginary Lands of Altiria because they thought it was just the trick of their imaginations. The shuttle landed on the first planet with mission support’s access granted. They were startled to know they could breathe there. The most startling thing though, was the humanoid inhabitants on the planet. They were the descendants of the lost expedition in 2031!
The people on the expedition long ago had brought plants on board to grow their own food if they ran out, so some of the plants on the planets were recognizable! There were trees with purple leaves, and sunflowers with blue petals and teal grass! 
The gravity on the planets was a little less than on Earth, so the trees grew bigger and taller. The air was thinner and it took a while to get used to, but otherwise the planets could sustain Life just fine. Finally Earth had found other planets with Life. The crew was uneasy about how the planets produced so much radiation. After close observation, the crew found out that the long lost crew had somehow absorbed some of the radiation from the plants. The absorbed radiation had passed down to their descendants.
This special radiation was called Magic.
The natives learned to use this Magic. The people back on Earth became jealous of the beautiful planets and claimed that they belonged to Earth. Their expedition had found the planets so Earth should rule them. Earth ordered the natives to leave and the natives who had lived there for over two hundred years refused. They threatened to use their Magic on Earth if they tried to take the planets and Earth was not intimidated by this. Earth declared war on the small six planets and the fight had begun. 



The long distance and the time it took to get from one solar system to the next made the war last longer than any war. After Fifty years of fighting, in the ILA Queen Pearl of Water Terra had a prophecy. Her Prophecy said,

Await the daughters of Pearl…
Await the time to unfurl,
Await the one of none…
Await the one of some.

Too much power is hidden away,
Who will decide to betray?

Two will end the tragic war of Magic,
Three will fly away,
And four will save the day.
